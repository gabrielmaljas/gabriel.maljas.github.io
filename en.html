                    <h1> Description </h1>
                    <h2> Masks is a Action-/ Adventure Game developed for a two weeks schoolproject. <br> The game tells the story of a pirate who travels from island to island to find valuable treasures. But on this island she 
                    discovers strange ghosts. These ghosts give her special abilities for her use.
                    <h1> Project task</h1>
                    <h2>      
                   The assignment on this project was to develop a game with the words &quot;Island&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Treasure&quot;. 
                   This game had to be created in the <a href="https://unity.com/de/our-company" style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(112, 112, 112);"> Game-Engine Unity </a> and with C#.
                    <br> Part of my inspiration came from the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away" style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(112, 112, 112);"> &quot;Spirited Away&quot; </a>. 
                    The ghosts in my game Masks share similarities in their appearances since both the <a href="#noface" style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(112, 112, 112);"> No-Face </a> from the movie and the ghosts in my game have no distinct body and a mask as a face.
                    As i wanted to use the theme of &quot;elementals&quot;, I found inspiration in the Nickelodeon series
                    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender"  style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(112, 112, 112);">&quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender&quot;</a>. 
                    I searched for abilities i could use for my game. In the end I used the <a href="#aang" style="text-decoration: none;color: rgb(112, 112, 112);"> riding on a airball </a> for my game. </h2>
